- 👋 Hi, I’m @alfred100p
- 👀 I’m interested in Deep Learninng, Machine Learning and AI (or just AI if we're being technical), also Frontend (as a hobby). I'm loyal to C++ yet I am part Pythonista.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PyTorch. I am improving my HTML/CSS and C++ but mainly PyTorch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing(not for ever though), I'm a bit busy now getting a solid footing, once that is over you can get me onboard anything you can convince me as interesting.
