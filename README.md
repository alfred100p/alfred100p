- 👋 Hi, I’m Alfred William Jacob (@alfred100p)


- Cheesy Quote: The world is my canvas my laptop is my paintbrush.


- 👀 I’m interested in Deep Learning, Machine Learning and AI (or just AI if we're being technical), also Frontend (as a hobby). I'm loyal to C++ yet I am part Pythonista.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PyTorch. I am improving my HTML/CSS and C++ but mainly PyTorch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Natural Language Processing, Cognitive AI or Reinforcement Learning-based Projects.
